Biplanes Revival
It's a PC version of original cellphone game "Bluetooth Biplanes" by
Morpheme Ltd.

Features:

	- Crossplatform

	- Easy matchmaking using peer-to-peer connection

	- Play with your friend using secret password

	- Easy to learn, hard to master gameplay

Written in C++ from scratch using sprites from original game

Netcode based on Simple Network Library
from "Networking for Game Programmers" by Glenn Fiedler

The main purpose was to recreate original feeling of game physics and
make playable multiplayer, so some singleplayer features ( such as AI )
aren't included.
